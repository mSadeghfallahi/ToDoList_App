Alembic Migration Environment
==============================

This directory contains Alembic migration scripts for the ToDo application.

Configuration
-------------
- The database URL is automatically loaded from `todo_app.config.Config` which reads from the `.env` file
- All models are automatically imported from `todo_app.models` to enable autogenerate
- The Base metadata is imported from `todo_app.db.base`

Usage
-----
1. Create a new migration after model changes:
   ```bash
   poetry run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description of changes"
   ```

2. Review the generated migration file in `versions/` before applying

3. Apply migrations:
   ```bash
   poetry run alembic upgrade head
   ```

4. Rollback migrations:
   ```bash
   poetry run alembic downgrade -1
   ```

5. Check current database revision:
   ```bash
   poetry run alembic current
   ```

6. View migration history:
   ```bash
   poetry run alembic history
   ```

7. Check for pending changes:
   ```bash
   poetry run alembic check
   ```

Autogenerate
------------
Alembic will automatically detect changes to your SQLAlchemy models when you use:
```bash
poetry run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "your message"
```

Always review the generated migration files before applying them, as Alembic may not detect all changes correctly (especially for complex changes like renaming columns).

Database Connection
-------------------
The database connection is configured in `env.py` to use:
- Database URL from `todo_app.config.Config.DATABASE_URL`
- Environment variables from `.env` file (DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_NAME)

Make sure your `.env` file is properly configured before running migrations.
